# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The Basic OLG Model** .

The OLG model is one of two main analytical frameworks for analyzing the basic intertemporal choice, consumption vs saving.  

OLG is set to capture potential interaction of different generations of individuals in the marketplace hence, providing a tractable alternative to the infinite-horizon economic models. In this project, we first derive the standard OLG model to show the standard results of the model. In addition, we show how a varying alpha will affect the slope of the steady state.

Finally, we show how the model can be solved, using the Gauss-Seidel method, using random variable values. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

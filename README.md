# Project portfolio

This portfolio consists of the following

* A .txt file containing a specification of our peer feedback

* The inaugural project, in which we were to maximize the utility of a consumer wrt. budget constraits for derivation of the optimal labor supply and consumption. 

* Data project containing an analysis of GNI of Denmark. We have drawn data from DST to analyse the development in this figure, as it has been seen how GNI can somehow be considered as a better indicator of a country's economic situation, as BNI also counts foreign income.  

* Model project of the standard OLG model with an example of Gauss-Seidel derivations using random variable values. 

* Examproject

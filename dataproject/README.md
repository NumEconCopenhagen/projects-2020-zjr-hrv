# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Analysis of Gross National Income**.

In this assignment, we look at GNI of Denmark. The GNI gives a indicate of the income level for the people of a certain country. In this case, we are looking at the income level of Denmark. 

To start with, we use some of the usual python package and a command called “pydst” to get data from DST. We clean the data, by removing some variables, which are irrelevant in this assignment and removing empty cells.
The Figure “GNI values for the entire dataset” show, how GNI have almost been constantly growing. 


The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).


**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
